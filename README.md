Smart grid bidding strategy in presence of demand response program (DRP) - 
Flexibility of smart grids has become an important issue due to the increasing penetration of uncertain energy resources 
such as renewable power plants in the smart grids. Flexibility tools, such as demand response (DR) programs and plug-in 
electric vehicles (PEVs), can help the smart grid to be more efficient and flexible. Although the renewable power plants 
are considered as flexible tools, they are uncertain themselves. In this work, the uncertainty of the generations of 
renewable resources such as wind and solar power plants has been resolved by the DR programs and PEVs. This work has 
presented a stochastic decision making model for the coordinated operation of wind and solar power producers, DR and PEV 
aggregators participating in the day-ahead market and has solved the risk-constrained optimal bidding strategy for a smart 
grid with uncertain day-ahead prices and renewable resources generations. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is considered 
in the model in order to account the uncertainties of day-ahead price and renewable resources generations. The results 
show the expected profit of all resources is increased and the related risk is reduced by the presented decision making model 
and bidding strategy for wind and solar power plants, DR and PEV.
